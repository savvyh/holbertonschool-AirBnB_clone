# General 🏋️‍♀️
So far, we have created our console for our Airbnb clone project. Now, we will make our website attractive by creating the front-end. We will study HTML and CSS in order to create the structure and style of our site.

## Requirements :oncoming_police_car:
- All files should end with a new line.
- The code should be W3C compliant and validate with W3C-Validator.
- All the CSS files should be in `styles` folder.
- All the images should be in `images` folder.
- Not allowed to use `!important` and `id` (#... in the CSS file).
- Not allowed to use tags `img`, `embed` and `iframe`.
- Not allowed to use Javascript.
- Current screenshots have been done on `Chrome 56` or more.
- No cross browsers.
- We have to follow all requirements but some margin/padding are missing - try to fit as much as you can to screenshots.
